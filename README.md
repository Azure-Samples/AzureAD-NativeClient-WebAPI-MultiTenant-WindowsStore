# Building a multi-tenant web API secured by Azure AD

**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0) Check it out: https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-xamarin-native-v2

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapi-multitenant-windows-store/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
